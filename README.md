# 🛡️ On-Chain Insurance for Verified Humans

> **A decentralized insurance protocol built on [World Chain](https://worldchain.world)**  
> Policies as NFTs · Automated claims via oracles · Payouts in stablecoins ·  
> Designed for real, verified humans — not bots.

## 🌍 Overview

Traditional insurance is opaque, slow, and full of intermediaries.  
**On-Chain Insurance** reimagines that model: all policies, claims, and payouts are handled by **smart contracts** on the **World Chain (Layer 2 / OP Stack)** network.

This system prioritizes *verified humans* through **World ID** and low-gas transactions, enabling frictionless coverage for everyone.

## ⚙️ Core Features

✅ **Policy NFTs** — Every active policy is minted as an ERC-721 NFT, representing ownership and coverage rights.  
✅ **Automated Claims** — Smart contracts process claims transparently with oracle-verified data.  
✅ **Instant Payouts** — Funds are released via the on-chain vault once eligibility is confirmed.  
✅ **World ID Integration** — Users verified as humans enjoy priority access and gas subsidies.  
✅ **Open Governance** — DAO-based configuration for risk parameters and reserves.  
✅ **Full Transparency** — All operations, decisions, and reserves are publicly auditable.
